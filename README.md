# Monochromatic

Monochromatic monorepo for [monochromatic.dev](https://monochromatic.dev)

~~Warning: Do not use `dprint` for now!
My `dprint.json` conflicts with some `eslint` rules.
Just wait.~~

Okay now it should be fine.

## Misc

(This section should be put into separate scratch files. But that can wait.)

### build.monochromatic.dev and config.monochromatic.dev

Stores the build system and config for the build system, respectively.

Wait, shouldn't the config for the build system be put into build.monochromatic.dev, too?
Maybe, but I kind of want the config files for everything to be put into the same place.

### build.monochromatic.dev how?

#### 1

Use `tsc` to build JavaScript (in many files, out many files)
and TypeScript definition files (also in many files, out many files).

Use `esbuild` to bundle ~~the resulting JavaScript files from `tsc`~~ the source TypeScript files into one JavaScript file.

#### 2

Use [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) (by Microsoft, just like TypeScript is by Microsoft)
to bundle TypeScript definition files generated by `tsc` into one file.

> This way we don't need to write and distribute two or more different `.tsconfig` files...I hope.

Use `terser` to minify JavaScript file.

#### Copy files into `final`
